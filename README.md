# Connect 4

"8-bit" styled take on a popular connection board game. Written as the first proper project at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/). The core problem was developing an algorithm that would check for diagonal victories. Besides that, I've added a deus-ex-machina "SPICED" mode, which makes the gameplay more interesting for both players. Try it out!
